A website for department fest of Computer Science and Engineering branch, GRIET.
This website details the happenings of the fest and also serves as a platform to know the information about various events.

I thank <a href="http://xtremelysocial.com/">Tim Nicholson</a> for making his awesome design available for free and making this website possible in very short span.
